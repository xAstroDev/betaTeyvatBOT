# common/notify

This slice handles the display of notifications. Since this logic is standard between all pages, it has been moved to the common namespace.

Actions defined in this module include:

-   `setPreferences`: Directly set the complete state of the app through a partial object.
-   `clearPreferences`: Set all slices to their initial states.
