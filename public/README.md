## tiles

This folder contains images of the world map at various zoom levels.

It was generated by extracting map images from the game files, compiling them manually into a complete map, then splitting it up using a script. The original assets and script are located in the `/assets` folder.

The images are of the format `Map_{z}_{x}_{y}.png`, where z is the zoom level from 3 to 8, and x and y are the coordinates, with (0,0) being somewhere towards the top left.
