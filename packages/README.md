# packages

This folder includes modifications of existing packages to implement fixes that are not in the main repository. This includes changes which have pending PRs, changes which do not apply to other projects, or changes whose pull requests have been rejected.

These packages are installed as local dependencies via Yarn. They are necessary for the project to build and run.
